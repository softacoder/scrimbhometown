    <!-- ABOUT -->
<p>
  My name is Jan Softa. I am Swedish and I have run a company for 12+ years. Here I have organized tech conferences and I want to get into do hackathons, both organize my own and as a participant at others hackathons. I have been part of a few successful hackathon teams. However, I did not code then, but focused on doing business plan, presentation, etc. I want to change it so I can do coding as well. I love hackthons!
Due to covid I have not been able to organize any tech conferences since October 2019. Eventually, I want to add coding to my work skills.<br>
  <br>
  I have a Master Degree from Sodertorn University College outside of Stockholm in Sweden. The main topic was Political Science with Russian language studies in both Sweden, St Petersburg and Moscow.<br>
  <br>
  
  After I finished university, I got invited to work and do research at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. Here I was during five years.
On a professional and personal level I am interested in tech as AI, blockchain, robotics, IoT and also in sport as ice hockey, football, f1 and so on. Music is also a passion of mine.
I think a little bit of coding skills should be mandatory in school for the young. There is such a huge demand for these skills and it gives job and a nice salary.
Today, software are in many, many products we use. Even in running shoes they use sensors and connect it to software. Supercool!
I can learn a lot coding from trying to understand products software. So when I am better at coding I want to do that. There are plenty of open source code at Github so I do not think I will ever run out of code to study.
Although, I have not coded before I know a few coders from hackathon, conferences and going to Skillsmatter. Skillsmatter have a lot of free to visit Meetups that I have gone too, even that I was not a coder. 

I think I picked up a little bit of code terminology from there so I have heard of Github, Dockers, AWS and Azure(cloud computing), Linux and so on.
I want to learn front-end and back-end coding since I believe it increases my understanding. It gives more possibilities to work on all types of interesting projects.<br>
  <br>
  I have built a few no coding (drag and drop) website and used Godaddy and Wordpress. Godaddys was easy to use and works fine for a landing page and Wordpress has more plugs-ins you can use but if you do not know coding you cannot customize. Over all, I found them to be at bit limited if you want to customize applications.
